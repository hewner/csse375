HINTS:


Hint Level 1:

The duplication to consider is in Game.java.  Look at the 2 functions betIsMade and placeBet.
Both of them use 0-2 to decide which code to run, just like DrawAllShapes used square and circle
to decide which code to run.  Just like Square and Circle became different subclasses, the 3
different kinds of bets will become subclasses in this example.























Hint Level 2:

Let's make our 3 subclasses subclasses of Bet.  You can already see that we've got an array of different
Bet objects (myPossibleBets).  We'll instead make this filled with different subclasses of bet.  Then
our code for placebet will look like:

    private String placeBet (int whichBet)
    {
        String result = myPossibleBets[whichBet].placeBet();

        return result;
    }
    
    
    








Hint Level 3:

Here's an example of what one of the 3 bet classes will look like

class RedOrBlackBet extends Bet
{
	public RedOrBlackBet() {
	    super("Red or Black", 1);
	}
	
	//implements newly created abstract method in Bet
	public String placeBet() {
	    ConsoleReader.promptOneOf("Please bet", Wheel.BLACK, Wheel.RED);
	}
	
	//implements newly created abstract method in Bet
	public String betIsMade (Wheel wheel, String betChoice)
	{
	    return myWheel.getColor().equals(betChoice);
	}

}
